Please see the README for [Steam Reviews](https://github.com/FEC-Bell/steam-reviews) for documentation, as the two services are very similar.

The only differences are:

- **Endpoints**: Game Description does not have any API endpoints.
- **PostgreSQL database name**: the database for Game Description should be initialized as `steam_game_descriptions`.
